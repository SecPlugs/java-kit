#### What is the Java Kit?
Use this client side Java SDK to build security solutions for any Java Based environment. 

#### What are the features?

- __File scanning__ - Scan files and directories for malware.
- __Email scanning__ - Send emails and attachments for malware and spam analysis.
- __{brand-name} Portal__ - With a registered API key you can access all the core {brand-name} features via the portal.

#### How does it work?

The library supports all the standard {brand-name} functionality allowing access to file web and email functionality and makes it easier than integrating directly with the REST APIs.

#### How do I get started?

To get started download the library, follow the instructions to get it installed and then take a look at the examples.

To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in {brand-root-domain}, login with your username and create an API key to use with the SDK replacing the default anonymous key.

Using your own key means you then use the {brand-name} console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.
