Use the library as is or modify to your needs.  

## Installation

```
You'll now have library available to use

## Usage
Usage pattern is instanciate a client class and then use its methods to scan items.

### Scan A File
Here, a very simple example of how to scan a file
```java
todo: java code here 
```
### Use Your Own API Key
To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering with {brand-name}, sign in with your username and [create an API key](docs?doc=docs/HowTo/CreateKey) 

After creating a key, the only change to the code sample above would be

```java
todo: mods to use ="your-api-key"
```

Everything else remains the same.
