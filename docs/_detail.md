#### What is the Java Kit?
Use this client side Java SDK to build security solutions for any Java Based environment. 

#### What are the features?

- __File scanning__ - Scan files and directories for malware.
- __Secplugs Portal__ - With a registered API key you can access all the core Secplugs features via the portal.

#### How does it work?

The library supports all the standard Secplugs functionality allowing access to file web and email functionality and makes it easier than integrating direclty with the REST APIs.

#### How do I get started?

To get started download the library, follow the instructions to get it installed and then take a look at the examples.

To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in Secplugs.com, login with your username and create an API key to use with the SDK replacing the default anonymous key.

Using your own key means you then use the Secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.
